                    <p class="description">
                    I was an IT Support Analyst for 6+ years across legal and <span class="big">#fintech</span> industries. My previous roles involved working closely with various teams to develop compliance and other regulatory documents, investigating root causes of failures for IT infrastructures and implementing a solution or quick work around. This helped me developed skills such as being a able to <i>'think on my feet'</i> and problem solving. <br><br>
                    I started self-studying basic HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. This sparked my interest in web development that I decided to change career. I got accepted for a highly selective and intensive four-month training program to become a high-quality professional software developer.
                    I am a <span class="big">dedicated</span> and highly motivated individual. Coupled with my <span class="big">fast learning</span> ability, I wish to join a team that will give exposure to new technologies and provide a collaborative learning environment. <br><br>
                    Now seeking my first <span class="big">junior front-end or full stack</span> web development role within an enthusiastic engineering team that can offer further development. <br><br> </p>
